"""
This file marks the 'foundry/actions' directory as a Python package.

This allows for the dynamic discovery and importing of action modules
(e.g., file_system_actions.py, ast_modification_actions.py) by the FoundryManager.
The presence of this file is essential for the packaging mechanism to work correctly,
and it groups all the callable tool functions in one logical place.
