"""
This file marks the 'blueprints' directory as a Python package.

This allows for the dynamic discovery and importing of blueprint modules
(e.g., write_file_bp.py, read_file_bp.py) by other parts of the application,
such as the FoundryManager. The presence of this file is essential for the
packaging mechanism to work correctly.
